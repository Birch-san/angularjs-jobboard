AngularJS Job Board v.1

This is an AngularJS study in which I built a simple job board. Built using Bootstrap, you may submit a new job opening using the form, then that new information will be stored as JSON in a file, which feeds the board.

Feel free to expand its functionality and don't forget to share the results! Sharing is caring. Cheers! ;)
